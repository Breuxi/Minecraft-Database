                </p>

                <h2>How does our site handle do not track signals?</h2>

                    We honor do not track signals and do not collect the data from those people for our metrics

                </p>

                <h2>Do we use cookies?</h2>
                <p>
                    Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer's hard
                    drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the site's or service provider's systems
                    to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information.

                </p>

                <h2>Third party links</h2>
                <p>
                    This website may contain links to other websites of interest.

                    These third party sites have separate and independent privacy policies.

                <h2>California Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance</h2>
                <p>
                    CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to
                    post a privacy policy.

                    The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or
                    company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting
                    personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous
                    privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals
                    with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy. -

                    http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf

                    According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Users can visit our site anonymously.</li>
                        <li>
                            Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page or as a
                            minimum on the first significant page after entering our website.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy'
                            and can be easily be found on the page specified above.
                        </li>
                        <li>Users will be notified of any privacy policy changes on our privacy policy page</li>
                        <li>Users are able to change their information by emailing us</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <h2>Childrens Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance</h2>
                <p>
                    When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under 13, the Children's
                    Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control.

                    The Federal Trade Commission, the nation's consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule,
                    which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's
                    privacy and safety online.

                    We do not specifically market to children under 13.
                </p>

                <h2>Online Privacy Policy Only</h2>
                <p>
                    This online privacy policy applies only to information collected through our website.
                </p>

                <h2>Does our site allow third-party behavioral tracking?</h2>
                <p>
                    It's also important to note that we do not allow third-party behavioral tracking
                </p>

                <h2>Fair Information Practices</h2>
                <p>
                    The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States
                    and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection
                    laws around the globe.

                    Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is
                    critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.

                    <br/>

                    In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action,
                    should a data breach occur: We will notify the users via in-site notification within 1 business days

                    <br/>

                    We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle, which requires that individuals have a right to
                    pursue legally enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the
                    law.

                    This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but
                    also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute
                    non-compliance by data processors.
                </p>
